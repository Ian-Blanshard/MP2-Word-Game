### Project Goals <a name="project-goals"></a>

The goal of this project is to create a word game, a short puzzle based game which is fun to plate and can be used to improve English language skills, expand your vocabulary and improve your literacy skills. 

### User stories <a name="user-stories"></a>

Users of this site may be:

1 A child who is looking for a fun way to improve their English language skills, they want:

  * A game which is simple, accessible and intuitive to play 
  * Colours which make the game attractive to play
  * The challenge of beating previous attempts
  * To be able to learn new words

2 An adult who enjoys traditional game such as scrabble and would like to practice their skills, they want:
 
  * A challenging game to help them improve existing language skills
  * A engaging experience which they can learn more about the words they create

### Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>
I used [figma](www.figma.com) to create wireframes for my project to get some of the ideas for layouts designed prior to starting to code them.
